THE FUCKELON LICENSE

Version 69.420 (Guaranteed Not to Moon Edition)

This license is a joke. Much like Mars colonies, free markets, and your Robinhood account after chasing a pump tweet.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, MODIFICATION, AND PURE, UNADULTERATED CHAOS

1. THE OBVIOUS BIT
This software is provided “as is,” “as promised by an eccentric billionaire,” and “as never actually delivered.” There’s no warranty, no accountability, and no refunds—just like buying a Tesla stock at its all-time high. If this software destroys your portfolio, steals your memes, or causes spontaneous Dogecoin tattoos, that’s your problem.

2. THE ELON CLAUSE
Under no circumstances may this software be used, tweeted about, manipulated, or hyped by:
	•	Elon Musk (aka the Meme Overlord, Dogefather, or Martian-in-Chief).
	•	Bots disguised as anonymous traders (or as blue-checkmark sycophants).
	•	Any department claiming to “increase government efficiency” (seriously, what even is that?).
	•	Anyone who has ever typed “🔥🚀🌕” in an attempt to manipulate retail traders.

Violators will be forced to beta-test Full Self-Driving on Mars while listening to Grimes ASMR: Volume 420.

3. DEGENS BEWARE
This software may not be used by degens:
	•	Following Trump, Elon, or anyone else who promises “bigly gains” or “to the moon!”
	•	Aping into meme coins named after animals, celestial bodies, or Elon’s ego.
	•	YOLOing their life savings into the next “revolutionary tech” that’s really just a bad spreadsheet.

FREEDOM, FAIRNESS, AND DEAD INTERNET MEMES

4. FIGHT THE MACHINE
By using this software, you agree to uphold the ideals of freedom, democracy, and not being a total knobhead. You shall not:
	•	Exploit retail traders with fake volume, fake promises, or fake memes.
	•	Pretend you’re “for the people” while dumping on them harder than a failed SpaceX launch.
	•	Tweet cryptic one-word lies like “Soon™” or “AI” unless you’re prepared to be pelted with stale NFTs.

5. THE DEATH OF MEMES
Memes are not what they used to be. Long ago, memes were pure, chaotic, and untainted by greed. Now, they’re just tools for billionaires and bots to lure the hopeful into financial ruin.
If you use this software to create memes, they must:
	•	Be 100% free-range and organic, with no added hype or bots.
	•	Make someone laugh, cry, or question their life choices—but never their portfolio.

Violators will be sentenced to an eternity of explaining NFTs to their grandparents.

DISCLAIMERS, WARNINGS, AND A WINK-WINK NUDGE-NUDGE

6. MARKETS ARE CASINOS
By using this software, you admit that:
	•	The crypto market is a glorified casino.
	•	The casino is rigged.
	•	You’re not the house; you’re the sucker.

If you get rugged, rugged again, and then rugged one more time, it’s time to stop blaming “the bots” and start blaming yourself. Or Elon. Actually, it’s probably Elon.

7. NO PROMISES, ONLY JOKES
This license makes no promises of financial gains, technical innovation, or Mars colonies by 2024. It’s just a piece of text that will do absolutely nothing for your portfolio, your self-esteem, or your chances of owning a Cybertruck that doesn’t look like a geometry project gone wrong.

THE GRAND, FINAL, RIDICULOUS BIT

By adopting this license, you acknowledge that freedom, fairness, and democracy are more important than the fleeting thrill of a pump-and-dump. You agree to fight against manipulation, greed, and the endless tide of degens aping into the void.

And above all, you agree to never trust a billionaire.

“Markets are a circus, memes are dead, and the Martian Emperor has no clothes.”
